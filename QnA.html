      Hi! We are pleased to invite Mr Doodle for an interview. Here are the ccontents.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b>Could you share a little about yourself and your journey to where you are in your artistic career?</b>
      I’m Mr Doodle! But my real name is Sam. I’m 23 years old and I’ve been doodling for as long as I can remember. 
      I have always loved to doodle because I think it is really fun and a very quick and accessible way to express 
      yourself. I doodled over all my exercise books at school and this eventually lead to me doodling over the school 
      walls and bits of furniture too. This has snowballed into my life as ‘Mr Doodle..’
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>What’s it like being Mr Doodle? Can you describe a typical day in your life?</b>
      It is fun! Each day is quite different to the next, some days I am spray doodling a van and some days I am drawing 
      over an office table. Sometimes I am working on digital animation commissions and others I am performing wacky doodle 
      dances for my Instagram feed. I usually work for about 14-16 hours a day and this consists of iPhone doodling, 
      sketchbook doodling, e mails, commissioned work and anything else that falls under my list of things to do that day.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>What are some big challenges you have faced in establishing yourself as an artist? What lessons have you learnt, 
        and how have you grown from them?</b>
      I represent myself for commissioned work so things like pricing my work and dealing with clients is something that 
      takes some getting used to, but it get’s easier after you’ve done it the first few times. It’s also a learning process 
      to figure out what kind of work is best for bringing you further work and focusing your energy on those kinds of projects. 
      I have grown because I have become less attached to each thing I make and less precious about everything being completely 
      correct.

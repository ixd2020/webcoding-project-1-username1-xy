       <h1>Mr Doodle</h1>
    
    <p>
      Mr Doodle is a doodler from England.
      His work consumes walls, furniture and many surfaces, almost like a virus 
      and is often described as 'Graffiti Spaghetti'. This is because his clusters 
      of characters, objects and patterns group together in a formation that appears 
      to continue to grow relentlessly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    He is a true doodle addict, Mr Doodle spends his days with a marker pen in-hand, 
    turning the world into his canvas. We recently caught up with Mr Doodle to hear 
    a bit more about how he came to be ‘Mr Doodle,’ and some of the challenges, exciting
    moments, and things that have inspired him along the way.
